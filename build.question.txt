 Q:1	What is acid properties.
	Atomicity means all or nothing
	Consistency means it makes sure that data is in consistent state.
	Isolation means Transactions are independent
	Durability means Committed data never lost




Q:2 How do you format and print a date at view?
Ans. By use date picker function. E.g.

<th align="left">Date Of Birth<font color="red">*</font></th>
<td><input type="text" name="dob" class="form-control"
id="datepicker"
value="<%=DataUtility.getDateString(bean.getDob())%>"
placeholder="yyyy/MM/dd">
<a href="javascript:getCalendar(document.forms[0].dob);"> </a>&nbsp;<font
color="red"><%=ServletUtility.getErrorMessage("dob", request)%></font></td>
</tr>

Q:3 What changes will you make on view, controller and model if you have to add one more search field at view?
Ans. View: make a text field and a submit button.
Controller: Populate the field by overriding populateBean() of BaseCtl class.
Model: Append that value through SQL injection in SQL query of respective method of that model(search).

if (bean.getExamDate() != null && bean.getExamDate().getDate() > 0) {
				sql.append(" AND EXAM_DATE = " + bean.getExamDate());
			}

search():-"SELECT * FROM ST_USER WHERE 1=1 AND ID =" " AND FIRST_NAME like '" + bean.getFirstName() + "%'" " Limit " + pageNo + ", " + pageSize

Q.4 write the code for search method?


	sql = select * from st_user where 1=1 AND NAME Like"bean.getFirstName()"+"%"

        sql.append(order by id desc)

	sql.append("limit"+pageNo+","+pageSize);

Q.5.write the code for search method?

*StringBuffer sql = new StringBuffer(
				"SELECT * FROM st_timetable WHERE true");

		if (bean != null) {
			
			if (bean.getCourseId() > 0) {

				sql.append(" AND CourseId =" + bean.getCourseId());
			}


Q.6     how will you do file attachment along with email?

	
	MimeBodyPart file = new MimeBodyPart();
	file.attachFile();
	Multipart mp = new MimeMultipart();
	mp.addBodyPart(file);

what if we wanna to attach 100 files 

the create multipart object 100 times and only one onject of mimebodypast.


Q.	What is mvc architecture.?
 	MVC is a framework technology. It separates code implementation of an application into three component Model,View and Controller.

Q.     how many layers are present in the mvc architecture?
	 there are Three layers in mvc 
	1.presentation layer (view logic) on JSP.
	2.navigation layer (controll logic) on SERVLET.
	3.business layer ( business logic,Data access logic,integration logic) on MODEL.

Q)	How Error msg come , also state the flow of ErrorCtl/?

	It come when the Application Exception Arose. (eg.when the internet access is off)
	FLOW:- when the Application Exception Arose in EmailUtility class. then servletUtility ki handleException() se Redirect karte h ErrorCtl par, fir waha se 
		ErrorView par.




63. write the code for search method?
*StringBuffer sql = new StringBuffer(
				"SELECT * FROM st_timetable WHERE true");

		if (bean != null) {
			
			if (bean.getCourseId() > 0) {

				sql.append(" AND CourseId =" + bean.getCourseId());
			}


1 non business pk k liye method 
Ans    public int nextPK()

2 query SELECT MAX(ID) FROM ST_COLLEGE

3 if page size is greater than zero then apply pagination 
pageSize > 0

	HiddenForm
	URL Rewriting

Q. 	How many way to destroy session?
 	There are three way of destroy session 
	1.session.invalidate();
	2.<session-config>
		<session-timeout>20<session-timeout>
	   </session-config>
	3.session.setMaxInactiveInterval();

Q.	How many types of create servlet.?
 	There are three type to create servlet 
	1.Servlet Interface
	2.GenericServlet Class 
	3.HttpServlet Class

Q.	What is servlet lifecycle.?
 	init()
	service()
	destroy()

Q.	Defference between generic servelt and http servlet.?
 	GenericServlet  defines a generic and protocol (set of rules) independent servlet. it implements Servlet interface that has lifecycle methods of a servlet.
	HttpServlet defines an HTTP protocol specific servlet. it inherits the GenericServlet class. 
	HttpServlet provides service methods such as doGet() and doPost() for handling HTTP specific services.

Q.	Differentiate between GET and POST?
        Form submitted is encoded in URL but not in doPost.
	Since data is sent through URL therefore its request size(Parameter size less than 2KB) is restricted But there is no restriction in doPost().
	It is unsecure because its Parameter remains in browser history but doPost is secure.
	Contains only character but in doPost it also contains binary data.
	can be cached and can be bookmarked but in doPost it cannot be cached and bookmarked. 

Q.	doGet & doPost???  view logic and submit 

Q.	When run for service method.?
	every request of user

Q.	Input & Bussiness validation are set in which scope? && Why not in session scope?
	REQUEST

Q.	Show methods of servlet which you have Extended? 
	HTTPSERVLET 		:- It inherit GenericServlet class, It is a base class of all servlets that handles HTTP requests.
	ITS METHODS ARE		:- doGet(), doPost(), doPut(), doHead(), doDelete() 
				   (ALSO DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN ITS doGet &doPost methods)

Q.	Difference between forword and send redirect.?
	Method forward() of request dispatcher object is used to forward request from one servlet to another servlet.
	Method sendRedirect of request dispatcher object is used to generate new request always and sent to another servlet.

Q.     how to enable session?
	HttpSession session = request.getSession(true);
	two method of Session 
	session.setAttributes();
	session.getAttributes();

Q.     difference between session(true) and session(false);	
	
	HttpSession session = request.getSession();
	if any session is existed in application it will get it; otherwise it will create new session.	
	HttpSession session = request.getSession(true);
	it always create new session.

Q.     how to set timeout for session in web.xml?
	<session-config>
		<session-timeout>20<session-timeout>
	</session-config>
       
Q.     what is the default timeout for session?
	web.xml 20 minutes(Server.xml)

Q.     difference between session and cookies?
 	session stored on server side and cookies stored in browser.
        
Q.     how to identify user on server?
 	By using session Tracking.
        
Q.	Who called service()?
	Container.
        
Q.	Who is calling validate()? 
	SERVICE() & IT IS CALLED BY CONTAINER & CONTAINER IS CALLED BY JVM.
            
Q.	 How you can check  that user logged in or not?? && And when does user State will show null??
	 On Header we are checking through session the statuss of user is null or not. OR we can also check it by session ID.
         
Q.	 Why did not we use request scope for logging instead of session?
	 Because if we do so then on every request of user we hve to authenticate user login id and password.
         
Q.	 Why devlopers are not recommended to override service method give reason?
	 Bcz it change the original defination of service().
	 (Eg.To perform generic operation provided by devloper.Bcz it call goGet() by default.)
        
Q.	 How a client can communicatee to server?
	 Using protocols. we used Http.

OOP RELATED QUESTIONS:-
========================
Q.	How can you achieve data abstration ?
   	Data Abstraction is process of hiding the implementation details and showing only the functionality.
		2. Data Abstration in java is achieved by using interface and abstract class.

Q.	How can you achieve full abstration in your application ?
 	by using interface.

Q.	 What is Abstract Class ?
	 Abstract class is used when parent need to provide default default behavior along with abstract method.It enforces child classes to impletment 			        specialized behavior of abstract methods. It can never be instantiated.

Q.	Why override service method?
	 We create custom ctl (BaseCtl) in which we write service method to provide generic operation flow. we are not recommended to override the service method.

Q.	Difference between static polymorphism and dynamic polymorphism.?
	static is done by overloadding . Eg. search(),list()   and dynamic is done method overriding.getKey(),getValue() of BaseBean.java.

Q.	 What is base bean .?
 	BaseBean is a parent class of all bean and it contains generic attributes.

Q.	What is basectl. And all methods.?
 	BaseCtl is parent ctl of all ctl and it contain generic work flow, generic operation,generic constants.
	Generic Work flow provides by services method.
	Generic Operation provides by basectl method. such as preload,validate,populateBean,getView().
	Generic Constants provides by all buttons.

	BaseBean (implement DropDownlistBean,Serializable,Comparable )
	BaseCtl(extends HttpServlet class)


Q.	How to call  preload and validate in service method.
 	by ovrriding it.

	(preload- on every user request
	validate- when operation is not null, delete, cancel, view , reset.)

Q.     why BaseBean is abstract class in your project?
 	Because we do not define two method of DropDownListBean Interface getKey() and getValue().

Q.     what is service method? is it compulsary to ovveride it?
 	service is called at every user request and it is not advisable to override the service method.

Q.     how u r performing encapsulation in your project?
	   encapsulations means gather all related infomation. By Creating Bean classes.

Q.     how you r using ovveriding concept in your project?
	  All basectl method 

Q.	***Did you use Dynamic(Runtime) and Static(Fixed) preload And if yes Where?
	Static by using hashmap object on view.				// more should be written on it.
	Dynamic by overriding preload().

Q.	Dynamic And Static Methods? 
	Overriding(Runtime polymorphism) And OverLoading.

Q.	Did you override validate method to put Input validations, if so From where you have overriden it?
					OR
	How you used Input validations in our project04? 
	BY OVERRIDING VALIDATE() in service() of BaseCtl.

Q.  	Do we have overidden validate() on our listCtl? 
	NO

Q.	How we achieved refrential integrity (Concept of FK) in our project?

Q.     write the code to make frontcontroller?



Q. 	Filter???
	Filter perform pre processing and post processsing on a request and response of a client.

	Filter intercepts incoming HttpRequest and perform pre processing operations before delivery request to the target servlet.
	when response is generated, it performs post processing operations before sending response back to client.

Q.	 Can we use more than a one frontCtl? if so how?
	 Yes, By using FilterChain object.doFilter(request,response)

Q.	 Definition of FrontCtl Design Pattern?
	 Single Handler for every client request.

Q.	how we can apply for frontctl?

	1.Servlet Interface
	2.GenericServlet Class 
	3.HttpServlet Class

Q.4	What is servlet lifecycle.?
 	init()
	service()
	destroy()

Q.5	Defference between generic servelt and http servlet.?
 	GenericServlet  defines a generic and protocol (set of rules) independent servlet. it implements Servlet interface that has lifecycle methods of a servlet.
	HttpServlet defines an HTTP protocol specific servlet. it inherits the GenericServlet class. 
	HttpServlet provides service methods such as doGet() and doPost() for handling HTTP specific services.

Q.6	Differentiate between GET and POST?
        Form submitted is encoded in URL but not in doPost.
	Since data is sent through URL therefore its request size(Parameter size less than 2KB) is restricted But there is no restriction in doPost().
	It is unsecure because its Parameter remains in browser history but doPost is secure.
	Contains only character but in doPost it also contains binary data.
	can be cached and can be bookmarked but in doPost it cannot be cached and bookmarked. 

Q.7	doGet & doPost??? submit and view logic

Q.8	When run for service method.?
	every request of user

Q.9	Input & Bussiness validation are set in which scope? && Why not in session scope?
	REQUEST

Q.10	Show methods of servlet which you have Extended? 
 	HTTPSERVLET 		:- It inherit GenericServlet class, It is a base class of all servlets that handles HTTP requests.
	ITS METHODS ARE		:- doGet(), doPost(), doPut(), doHead(), doDelete() 
				   (ALSO DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN ITS doGet &doPost methods)

Q.11	Difference between forword and send redirect.?
	Method forward() of request dispatcher object is used to forward request from one servlet to another servlet.
	Method sendRedirect of request dispatcher object is used to generate new request always and sent to another servlet.

Q.12     how to enable session?
	HttpSession session = request.getSession(true);
	two method of Session 
	session.setAttributes();
	session.getAttributes();

Q.13    difference between session(true) and session(false);	
	
	HttpSession session = request.getSession();
	if any session is existed in application it will get it; otherwise it will create new session.	
	HttpSession session = request.getSession(true);
	it always create new session.

Q.14    how to set timeout for session in web.xml?
	<session-config>
		<session-timeout>20<session-timeout>
	</session-config>

Q.15    what is the default timeout for session?
	web.xml 20 minutes(Server.xml)

Q.16    difference between session and cookies?
 	session stored on server side and cookies stored in browser.

Q.17    how to identify user on server?
 	By using session Tracking.

Q.18	Who called service()?
	Container.

Q.19	Who is calling validate()? 
	SERVICE() & IT IS CALLED BY CONTAINER & CONTAINER IS CALLED BY JVM.

Q.20	 How you can check  that user logged in or not?? && And when does user State will show null??
	 On Header we are checking through session the statuss of user is null or not. OR we can also check it by session ID.

Q.21	 Why did not we use request scope for logging instead of session?
	 Because if we do so then on every request of user we hve to authenticate user login id and password.

Q.22	 Why devlopers are not recommended to override service method give reason?
	 Bcz it change the original defination of service().
	 (Eg.To perform generic operation provided by devloper.Bcz it call goGet() by default.)

Q.23	 How a client can communicatee to server?
	 Using protocols. we used Http.

3.) service() should be overridden being abstract in super interface.
service() method need not be overridden.

4.) It is a must to use service() method as it is a callback method.
Being service() is non-abstract, it can be replaced by doGet() or doPost() methods.

5.) Extends Object and implements interfaces Servlet, ServletConfig and Serializable.	
Extends GenericServlet and implements interface Serializable

6.) Direct subclass of Servet interface.	
Direct subclass of GenericServlet.

  ( bean class)
Exceptions are events that occur during the execution of programs that disrupt the normal flow of instructions (e.g. divide by zero, array access out of bound, etc.).
In Java, an exception is an object that wraps an error event that occurred within a method and contains:



1.what is bean class and why used
 
	it is generate a setter getter.
	its used to access seurly over data.
	also access to private attribute. 

2.what is serialization and  used
		
		To convert a state in binary from.
		used in send the from network.
  *or over the layer datako tranfer k liye

3.what is static used
	
		static is keyword.then used to memory managment.

4.what is private

		It is access modifier.use in only over class.

5.what is interface

		It is a abstract class.
		they keep a final attribute and abstarct method.

6.what is abstract class and used
		
* It is a keyword.
* when create a class abstract they froce to child to provide a impilimentation through child.

7.what is comparable
 
 it's a interface.used to compare a current object to same type of object using a comapreTo() method.through natural odering. 

8.what class, object ,overloading , overriding , encapsulation,polymorphim


         class:- class is blueprint from of object.keyword,and also logical entity.*

         object:-It is an instance of class and provide a physical entity.

         overloding:-It a static binding.used in method for a same class.method overloding is  same name but different
 parameter list.
 
         overriding:-It is dyanamic binding.used in method  for differnt class.method overriding same name and also same
 parameterlist.

         encapsulation:-wappring up data into single unit.

         polymorphim:-one name many from provide dynamic behaviour at run time.


9.what is instance and declared *
          
		  instance:-which is allocate a memory using new keyword.

         	  declared:-when we create a object of class.

10.what this and super*

         this:-is a reference variable that refers to the current object.

         super:-The super keyword in java is a reference variable that is used to refer immediate parent class object.

Whenever you create the instance of subclass, an instance of parent class is created implicitly i.e. referred by super reference variable.

23.what is string ,buffer ,builder

               String:- String is a set of characters in java. String create in java create object of "String" class.IT is final and immutable.

               StringBuffer:-It is mutable.It is multi user system and also a syncronized and also a thread safe.

               String builder:-It is also mutable but single user system.An ansyncronized and not thread safe.  


11.what is inhertance:-
		child class to reuse the property and method of parents class.


12.Difference between abstract and interface *
	
Abstract class  ////	Interface
1) Abstract class can have abstract and non-abstract methods.	Interface can have only abstract methods.
2) Abstract class doesn't support multiple inheritance.	Interface supports multiple inheritance.
3) Abstract class can have final, non-final, static and non-static variables.	Interface has only static and final variables.
4) Abstract class can have static methods, main method and constructor.	Interface can't have static methods, main method or constructor.
***********************************************
5) Abstract class can provide the implementation of interface.	Interface can't provide the implementation of abstract class.
***********************************************
6) The abstract keyword is used to declare abstract class.	The interface keyword is used to declare interface.
7) Example:
public abstract class Shape{
public abstract void draw();
}	Example:
public interface Drawable{
void draw();
}
 			 

13.what is final and used 
 		
final is a keyword.
used: final used in restrict the [variable,method, class]
when variable use in final they become a constatnt. when method is final they can not be override.
class is final they can not be inherited.

14.what is used append keyword
  
	This method updates the value of the object that invoked the method.The method takes boolean, char, int,
	 long, Strings, etc.

15.what is checked and unchecked

	*     checked is type of exception and its mandatory to handal.
	
	*     unchcked is type of exception and its is optional. 

15.write 5 exception method *
       printStackTace(),getMeassege(),ToString(),getLocalizedMessage(),fillInStackTrace()

16.what is difference between throw and throws 
	
	*throws:it is system generated.come in runtime when an exception event is occurred.

	*throw:It is programmer can instantiate and rise an exception to represent a some type of error with in application. 

17.why we used to-string *
	
converted to string method.
The java toString() method is used when we need a string representation of an object. It is defined in Object class. 
This method can be overridden to customize the String representation of the Object.


18.what is iterater ?
Iterator interface provides the facility of iterating the elements in forward direction only.
Methods of Iterator interface

There are only three methods in the Iterator interface. They are:

public boolean hasNext() it returns true if iterator has more elements.
public object next() it returns the element and moves the cursor pointer to the next element.
public void remove() it removes the last elements returned by the iterator. It is rarely used.

19.what is hashmap *(change)
	
	HashMap maintains key and value pairs and often denoted as HashMap<Key, Value> or HashMap<K, V>. HashMap implements Map interface.It neither does any kind of sorting to the stored keys and Values. You must need to import java.util.HashMap or its super class in order to use the HashMap class and methods

**20.what is synchronization block and method (checked)
			
synchronized method -acquires a method on the whole object. 
This means no other thread can use any synchronized method in the whole object while the method is being run by one thread. 

synchronized blocks -acquires a lock in the object between parentheses after the synchronized keyword
	
21.difference b/w java.utill.date and java.sql.date*
	      
            1.java.sql.Date is a thin wrapper around millisecond value which is used by JDBC to identify an SQL DATE type.

            2. java.sql.Date just represent DATE without time information while java.util.Date represent both Date and Time information. This is the major differences why java.util.Date can not directly map to java.sql.Date.

            3. In order to suppress time information and to conform with definition of ANSI SQL DATE type, the millisecond values used in java.sql.Date instance must be "normalized by setting the hours, minutes, seconds and milliseconds to zero in the timezone with with DATE instance is associated. 

In other words all time related information is removed from java.sql.Date class.




22.what is static and dynmaic polymorphism *

	static  :polymorphism is compile time.
	dynamic :polymorphism is run time.

21.diferent b/w forward and sendredirect**
***The forward() method works at server side.
It sends the same request and response objects to another servlet.	
***The sendRedirect() method works at client side.
It always sends a new request.
It can work within the server only.It can be used within and outside the server.


Example: request.getRequestDispacher("servlet2").forward(request,response);	
Example: response.sendRedirect("servlet2");



22.what is a cookie and session
Cookies :- cookies is  key and value  pair (key = value )

Q1.what is jsp
    Ans:-JavaServer Pages (JSP) is a technology that helps software developers create 
	dynamically generated web pages based on HTML, XML, or other document types. 
	Released in 1999 by Sun Microsystems, JSP is similar to PHP and ASP, but it uses the 
	Java programming language

Q2.jsp life cycle
Jspinti
_jspservice it is a not ovverride
jspdestory

Ans:-A JSP page is converted into Servlet in order to service requests. 
The translation of a JSP page to a Servlet is called Lifecycle of JSP. JSP Lifecycle is 
exactly same as the Servlet Lifecycle, with one additional first step, which is, translation 
of JSP code to Servlet code. Following are the JSP Lifecycle steps:

a.Translation of JSP to Servlet code.
b.Compilation of Servlet to bytecode.
c.Loading Servlet class.
d.Creating servlet instance.
e.Initialization by calling jspInit() method
f.Request Processing by calling _jspService() method
g.Destroying by calling jspDestroy() method

Q3.jsp element

Ans:-JSP Scripting element are written inside <% %> tags. These code inside <% %> tags 
are processed by the JSP engine during translation of the JSP page. Any other text in the 
JSP page is considered as HTML code or plain text.
There are five different types of scripting elements

Scripting Element		Example
Comment			<%-- comment --%>
Directive		<%@ directive %>
Declaration		<%! declarations %>
Scriptlet		<% scriplets %>
Expression		<%= expression %>

Q4.execption handling jsp

The exception is normally an object that is thrown at runtime. Exception Handling is 
the process to handle the runtime errors. There may occur exception any time in your web 
application. So handling exceptions is a safer side for the web developer. In JSP, there are 
two ways to perform exception handling:

a.By errorPage and isErrorPage attributes of page directive
b.By <error-page> element in web.xml file

Q5.difeerence b/w Directive and action tag

Ans:-Include directive and include action tag both are used for including a file to the 
current JSP page. However there is a difference in the way they include file. Before I explain
 the difference between them, lets have a brief about each one.

a.JSP Include Directive

index.jsp
<html>
<head>
<title>JSP include Directive example</title>
</head>
<body>
<%@ include file="display.jsp" %>
</body>
</html>
b.JSP Include Action tag

index.jsp
<html>
<head>
<title>JSP include Action example</title>
</head>
<body>
<jsp:include page="display.jsp" />
</body>
</html>



Q6.describe <jsp:usebean> tag

Ans:-The jsp:useBean action tag is used to locate or instantiate a bean class. 
If bean object of the Bean class is already created, it doesn't create the bean depending on 
the scope. But if object of bean is not created, it instantiates the bean.


Q7.what is implicit object why we use

There are 9 jsp implicit objects. These objects are created by the web container that 
are available to all the jsp pages.
The available implicit objects are out, request, config, session, application etc.
A list of the 9 implicit objects is given below:

Object						Type
out					JspWriter
request					HttpServletRequest
response				HttpServletResponse
config					ServletConfig
application				ServletContext
session					HttpSession
pageContext				PageContext
page					Object
exception				Throwable


Q8.what is scope of bean
Ans:-

Q9.what is servlet annotation

Ans:-Annotation represents the metadata. If you use annotation, deployment descriptor
 (web.xml file) is not required. But you should have tomcat7 as it will not run in the 
previous versions of tomcat. @WebServlet annotation is used to map the servlet with the 
specified name.

Q10.@webServlet and @filter use
Ans:-

Q11.what is filter

Ans:-A filter is an object that is invoked at the preprocessing and postprocessing of a 
request.
It is mainly used to perform filtering tasks such as conversion, logging, compression, 
encryption and decryption, input validation etc.
The servlet filter is pluggable, i.e. its entry is defined in the web.xml file, 
if we remove the entry of filter from the web.xml file, filter will be removed automatically 
and we don't need to change the servlet
	

            Usage of Filter

a.recording all incoming requests
b.logs the IP addresses of the computers from which the requests originate
c.conversion
d.data compression
e.encryption and decryption
f.input validation etc.
	
         Advantage of Filter

a.Filter is pluggable.
b.One filter don't have dependency onto another resource.
c.Less Maintenance

Q12.filter life cycle & why we used filterchain object.

Ans:- filters life cycle:
The life cycle of a filter is managed by a container. Every
filter must implement the Filter interface. The life cycle
of a filter consists of implementing the following methods:

1. init(): This method is called only once after
instantiation to perform any initialization task.

2. doFilter(): This method is called after the init()
method. It takes three arguments, namely a ServletRequest, a
ServletResponse, and a FilterChain. It is called each time a
filter needs to perform any function. This method performs
the actual work of a filter, either modifying the request or
the response.

3. destroy(): This method is used to perform any cleanup
operation before the container removes a filter instance.

Q13.why we used filterchain object
Ans:- 

Q14.what and why filter Configuration
Ans:- An object of FilterConfig is created by the web container. This object can be used to 
get the configuration information from the web.xml file.

Q15.what is frontcontroller
Ans:- The front controller software design pattern is listed in several pattern catalogs and 
related to the design of Web applications. It is "a controller that handles all requests for a 
Web site", which is a useful structure for Web application developers to achieve the 
flexibility and reuse without code redundancy.

Q16.why we used frontcontroller
Ans:- The front controller software design pattern is listed in several pattern 
catalogs and related to the design of Web applications. It is "a controller that handles 
all requests for a Web site", which is a useful structure for Web application developers to 
achieve the flexibility and reuse without code redundancy.

Q17.write a code frontcontroller
Ans:-

Q18.difference b/w authentication and authorization
Ans:-
a.Authentication is the process of verifying who you are. When you log on to a 
PC with a user name and password you are authenticating.

b.Authorization is the process of verifying that you have access to something. 
Gaining access to a resource (e.g. directory on a hard disk) because the permissions
 configured on it allow you access is authorization.

Q19.whAT IS the version of jsp
Ans:-2.3

Q20.how many instance of a jsp are created to handle multiple concurrent user request
Ans:-single

Q21.why we use jsp as a view
Ans:-JavaServer Pages are built on top of the Java Servlets API, 
so like Servlets, JSP also has access to all the powerful Enterprise Java APIs, 
including JDBC, JNDI, EJB, JAXP, etc. JSP pages can be used in combination with servlets 
that handle the business logic, the model supported by Java servlet template engines.

Q22.how you can define method in a jsp
Ans;- 

Q23.how you can declare instance variable in a jsp
Ans:-jsp:use bean tag 
 
 
 
Log4j? 1.4
?What is log4j?
Ans. Log4j is a framework that we  use in java for logging messages on console, file, database , network, etc.
What is log4j.?
*log4j is an standared approach to print a message consol network ...........etc
?What is logging?
Ans. Logging is a simple technique for printing  messages and logging statements are embedded into program source code during code development.
?Logging Message Categories:
 
Messages may be of different categories
 
1.	Debug messages (Lowest Priority)
1.	Required to test Program/method flow and Watch variables values
2.	Information
1.	Some information like Email Server is started
3.	Warning messages
1.	Warning likes Email Server is down right now, emails may be delayed.
4.	Error messages
1.	Error messages like Invalid User ID/Password for SMS Gateway
5.	Fatal messages (Highest Priority)
1.	Shop stopper messages like Database is Down

Debug Messages are shown only in development environment
?How many logging destinations are there in log4j?
Ans. 
1.>	Console
2.>	File
3.>	Remote Server 
4.>	Database
?What is Appender?
Ans. Appender is an output destination on which messages  are logged.
?What are Layouts?
Ans. To customize the output destination and output format we associate a layout with appender. The layout is responsible for formatting the  logging request according to the user's wishes. In log4j we use pattern layout.
log4j.appender.stdout.layout.ConversionPattern=%d{dd MM yy HH:mm:ss} %5p %c{1}:%L - %m%n
1.>	%d{dd MM yy HH:mm:ss}? Used to output the date of the logging event. The date conversion specifier may be followed by a date format specifier enclosed between braces. For example, %d{HH:mm:ss,SSS} or %d{dd MMM yyyy HH:mm:ss,SSS}. If no date format specifier is given then ISO8601 format is assumed.
2.>	%p ? Used to output the priority of the logging event.
3.>	%c{1}? Used to output the category of the logging event. For example, for the category name "a.b.c" the pattern %c{2} will output "b.c".
4.>	%L? Used to output the line number from where the logging request was issued.
5.>	%m? Used to output the application supplied message associated with the logging event. 
6.>	%n? Outputs the platform dependent line separator character or characters.
?What is logger?
Ans. Logger is a component that accepts or enable log request generated by log statements during application execution and sends them to their output destination.

Category	Description
debug	developing only, for debugging purpose
info	Production optionally, Course grained (rarely written informations), I use it to print that a configuration is initialized, a long running import job is starting and ending.
warn	Production, simple application error or unexpected behaviour. Application can continue. I warn for example in case of bad login attemps, unexpected data during import jobs.
error	Production, application error/exception but application can continue. Part of the application is probably not working.
fatal	Production, fatal application error, application cannot continue, for example database is down.

1. public class Logger- Logger is responsible for handling the majority of log operations. 
2. public interface Appender - Appender is responsible for controlling the output of log operations. 
3. public abstract class Layout-Layout is responsible for formatting the output for Appender.
?How do you configure log4j?
Ans. Using log4j.properties name
?How do you disable debug messages in your application?
Ans. In Log4j use 
Log4j.rootLogger= inf0,file , stdout
Since info has high priority then debug so debug messages will be hidden.
?How do you set message level to be logged?
?Which design pattern pattern is followed by log4j?
Ans. Log4J getLogger() method hides the real implementation returned. The only thing you know is that it is a subclass of Logger.
Kind of Abstract Factory or Factory Method that hides the instantiation of the real object. You don't have to write any new keyword.

1.Common Appenders
 	FileAppender, it appends log events to a file.
 	RollingFileAppender, it extends FileAppender to backup the log files when they reach a certain size.
 	DailyRollingFileAppender -it extends FileAppender so that the underlying file is rolled over at a user chosen frequency.
 	ConsoleAppender - it appends log events to System.out or System.err using a layout specified by the user. The default target is System.out.
 
2. Network Appenders
 	SocketAppender - it sends LoggingEvent objects to a remote a log server, usually a SocketNode.
 	SocketHubAppender - it sends LoggingEvent objects to a set of remote log servers, usually a SocketNodes .
 	JMSAppender - A simple appender that publishes events to a JMS Topic. The events are serialized and transmitted as JMS message type ObjectMessage. .
 	NTEventLogAppender - Append to the NT event log system.
 
3. Third-party Appenders
 	JDBCAppender by Danko Mannhaupt (recommended over the current JDBCAppender included)
 	SNMPTrapAppender
 
4. Special Appenders
 	AsyncAppender - it lets users log events asynchronously. It uses a bounded buffer to store logging events.
 	ExternallyRolledFileAppender - This appender listens on a socket on the port specified by the PORT_OPTION for a "RollOver" message. When such a message is received, the underlying log file is rolled over and an acknowledgment message is sent back to the process initiating the roll over.
 	JDBCAppender - it provides for sending log events to a database.
 	LF5Appender - it logs events to a swing based logging console. The swing console supports turning categories on and off, multiple detail level views, as well as full text searching and many other capabilties.
 	NullAppender (theres two, one for internal operations & one for benchmarking)
 	SMTPAppender - it sends an e-mail when a specific logging event occurs, typically on errors or fatal errors.
 	SyslogAppender - it sends messages to a remote syslog daemon.
 	TelnetAppender - it is a log4j appender that specializes in writing to a read-only socket.
 	WriterAppender - WriterAppender appends log events to a Writer or an OutputStream depending on the user's choice.
5. Custom Appenders
Custom Appenders can be created by implementing Appender interface.


Log4J-FAQ


ow many environment are there in Log4j framework?
 Ans.. 4 environment are there in log4j
1. Devlopment
2. Testing
3. Staging
4. Production

Q: How do you configure Log4J.
A: We configure it with help of log4j.properties file.

Q: Where do you keep log4j.properties file.
A: We keep it in ./WEB-INF/classes folder in web application.  In desktop application we keep it in .\bin folder and include .\bin folder in CLASSPATH.

Q: How do you disable  debug messages in your application?
A: Set  log4j.rootLogger=info, stdout in log4j.properties.   Since debug has lower priority than info so debug messages will be hidden. 

Q: How many message levels are there?
A: There are 5 levels of messages: debug, info, warn, error, fatal.  Debug has the lowest priority and Fatal has  the highest priority.   

Q: How do you set message level to be logged?
A: We set log4j.rootLogger property  In log4j.properties file.  If any level is set then that level and its high priority messages will be logged.

Q: Which design pattern is followed by Log4J?
A:  Factory design pattern is followed by Logger.getLogger(this.getClass()) statement.  Since Logger object is created by this statement so it follows Factory design patterns.

Q: What is Appender ?
A: Appender are targets on which messages are logged.  There multiple appenders like File, Console, Database, Socket etc. 

Q: What is Release Note ?
A: Release Note is a MS Word Doc file that is made for every build.  

Release Note contains

1.	Build Number.
2.	List of new implemented functionality  
3.	List of fixed Bugs
4.	List of Open Bugs
5.	List of Known issues 





Singleton design pattern in Java
1.	Singleton design pattern in Java
Singleton Pattern says that just"define a class that has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it".
In other words, a class must ensure that only single instance should be created and single object can be used by all other classes.
There are two forms of singleton design pattern
o	Early Instantiation: creation of instance at load time.
o	Lazy Instantiation: creation of instance when required.
________________________________________
Advantage of Singleton design pattern
o	Saves memory because object is not created at each request. Only single instance is reused again and again.
________________________________________
Usage of Singleton design pattern
o	Singleton pattern is mostly used in multi-threaded and database applications. It is used in logging, caching, thread pools, configuration settings etc.
________________________________________
Uml of Singleton design pattern
o	Factory Method Pattern allows the sub-classes to choose the type of objects to create.
o	It promotes the loose-coupling by eliminating the need to bind application-specific classes into the code. That means the code interacts solely with the resultant interface or abstract class, so that it will work with any classes that implement that interface or that extends that abstract class.

 
________________________________________
How to create Singleton design pattern?
To create the singleton class, we need to have static member of class, private constructor and static factory method.
o	Static member: It gets memory only once because of static, itcontains the instance of the Singleton class.
o	Private constructor: It will prevent to instantiate the Singleton class from outside the class.
o	Static factory method: This provides the global point of access to the Singleton object and returns the instance to the caller.
________________________________________
Understanding early Instantiation of Singleton Pattern
In such case, we create the instance of the class at the time of declaring the static data member, so instance of the class is created at the time of classloading.
Let's see the example of singleton design pattern using early instantiation.

Ans...Session simply means a particular interval of time.
             Session Tracking is a way to maintain state of an user.Http protocol is a stateless protocol.Each time user requests to the server, 
server treats the request as the new request.So we need to maintain the state of an user to recognize to particular user.
1. Cookies
2. HttpSession
3. HiddenFormField
4. URL rewriting

11.	How many types of create servlet.

     2. Extends genericServlet class
     3. Extends httpServlet class

12.	What is servlet lifecycle.
Ans..1. Load Servlet class,creates Servlet instanc, calls init() method.
2. Container invokes service() method and pass client request and response objects to this method.
3. If container needs to remove Servlet then calls destroy() method.

13.	Defference between jboss and tomcat,
Ans.. 1. JBoss is a application server and tomcat is a web server.
2.

14. Defference between web server and application server.
Ans..1.In terms of logical difference between web server and application server. web server is supposed to provide http protocol level service while application server provides support to web service and expose business level service e.g. EJB. 

2.Though its not limited to Application Server but they used to provide services like Connection pooling, Transaction management, messaging, clustering, load balancing and persistence. Now Apache tomcat also provides connection pooling. 

3.Application Server supports distributed transaction and EJB. While Web Server only supports Servlets and JSP. 

4.Application server are more heavy than web server in terms of resource utilization. 

15.	Defference between checked exception and unchecked exception.
Ans..

16. Defference between comparable and comparator.
Ans..Comparable	               Comparator
1) Comparable provides single sorting sequence. In other words, we can sort the collection on the basis of single element such as id or name or price etc.	                    
   Comparator provides multiple sorting sequence. In other words, we can sort the collection on the basis of multiple elements such as id, name and price etc.

2) Comparable affects the original class i.e. actual class is modified.	
            Comparator doesn't affect the original class i.e. actual class is not modified.

3) Comparable provides compareTo() method to sort elements.	                
                   Comparator provides compare() method to sort elements.

4) Comparable is found in java.lang package.	
      Comparator is found in java.util package.

5) We can sort the list elements of Comparable type by Collections.sort(List) method.
           We can sort the list elements of Comparator type by collections.sort(List,Comparator) method

17.	Defference between generic servelt and http servlet.
Ans..GENERICSERVLET	     HTTPSERVLET
1.) Can be used with any protocol (means, can handle any protocol). Protocol independent.--
Should be used with HTTP protocol only (can handle HTTP specific protocols) . Protocol dependent.

2.) All methods are concrete except service() method. service() method is abstract method.	
All methods are concrete (non-abstract). service() is non-abstract method.

3.) service() should be overridden being abstract in super interface.
service() method need not be overridden.

4.) It is a must to use service() method as it is a callback method.
Being service() is non-abstract, it can be replaced by doGet() or doPost() methods.

5.) Extends Object and implements interfaces Servlet, ServletConfig and Serializable.	
Extends GenericServlet and implements interface Serializable

6.) Direct subclass of Servet interface.	
Direct subclass of GenericServlet.

7.) Defined javax.servlet package.	Defined javax.servlet.http package.

8.) All the classes and interfaces belonging to javax.servlet package are protocol independent.	
All the classes and interfaces present in javax.servlet.http package are protocol dependent (specific to HTTP).

18.	Defference between forword and send redirect.
Ans..forward is used to forward request from one page to another with in the same applicaltion 

where as sendRedirect i used to forward request between multiple applications or servers 

same request is forwarded to another page where as new request is generated to forward via reDirect()

called over the object of RequestDispatcher Where as reDirect is called over the object of session.

redirect is slow as compared to forward() as it needs to genetate a new request to forward.

19.	Defference between string buffer and string builder.
Ans...stringBuffer.                stringBuilder
1.)Synchronized.                ASynchronized
2.)Thread safe.                   Not thread safe
3.)used in muilti User system.      Used in single user system.

20.	Defference between static polymorphism and dynamic polymorphism.
Ans..

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 ( bean class)
1.what is bean class and why used
 
	it is generate a setter getter.
	its used to access seurly over data.
	also access to private attribute. 

2.what is serialization and  used
		
		To convert a state in binary from.
		used in send the from network.
  *or over the layer datako tranfer k liye

3.what is static used
	
		static is keyword.then used to memory managment.

4.what is private

		It is access modifier.use in only over class.

5.what is interface

		It is a abstract class.
		they keep a final attribute and abstarct method.

6.what is abstract class and used
		
* It is a keyword.
* when create a class abstract they froce to child to provide a impilimentation through child.

7.what is comparable
 
 it's a interface.used to compare a current object to same type of object using a comapreTo() method.through natural odering. 

8.what is class, object ,overloading , overriding , encapsulation,polymorphim


         class:- class is blueprint from of object.keyword,and also logical entity.*

         object:-It is an instance of class and provide a physical entity.

         overloding:-It a static binding.used in method for a same class.method overloding is  same name but different parameter list.
 
         overriding:-It is dyanamic binding.used in method  for differnt class.method overriding same name and also same parameterlist.

         encapsulation:-wappring up data into single unit.

         polymorphim:-one name many from provide dynamic behaviour at run time.


9.what is instance and declared *
          
		  instance:-which is allocate a memory using new keyword.

          declared:-when we create a object of class.

10.what this and super*

         this:-is a reference variable that refers to the current object.

         super:-The super keyword in java is a reference variable that is used to refer immediate parent class object.

Whenever you create the instance of subclass, an instance of parent class is created implicitly i.e. referred by super reference variable.

23.what is string ,buffer ,builder

  		    String:- String is a set of characters in java. String create in java create object of "String" class.It is final and immutable.

               StringBuffer:-It is mutable.It is multi user system and also a syncronized and also a thread safe.

               String builder:-It is also mutable but single user system.An ansyncronized and not thread safe.  


11.what is inhertance:-
		child class to reuse the property and method of parents class.


12.Difference between abstract and interface *
	
Abstract class  ////	Interface
1) Abstract class can have abstract and non-abstract methods.	Interface can have only abstract methods.
2) Abstract class doesn't support multiple inheritance.	Interface supports multiple inheritance.
3) Abstract class can have final, non-final, static and non-static variables.	Interface has only static and final variables.
4) Abstract class can have static methods, main method and constructor.	Interface can't have static methods, main method or constructor.
***********************************************
5) Abstract class can provide the implementation of interface.	Interface can't provide the implementation of abstract class.
***********************************************
6) The abstract keyword is used to declare abstract class.	The interface keyword is used to declare interface.
7) Example:
public abstract class Shape{
public abstract void draw();
}	Example:
public interface Drawable{
void draw();
}
 			 

13.what is final and used 
 		
final is a keyword.
used: final used in restrict the [variable,method, class]
when variable use in final they become a constatnt. when method is final they can not be override.
class is final they can not be inherited.

14.what is used append keyword
  
			This method updates the value of the object that invoked the method.The method takes boolean, char, int, long, Strings, etc.

15.what is checked and unchecked

	*     checked is type of exception and its mandatory to handal.
	
	*     unchcked is type of exception and its is optional. 

15.write 5 exception method *
       printStackTace(),getMeassege(),ToString(),getLocalizedMessage(),fillInStackTrace()

16.what is throw and throws and difference
	
	*throws:it is system generated.come in runtime when an exception event is occurred.

	*throw:It is programmer can instantiate and rise an exception to represent a some type of error with in application. 

17.why we used to-string *
	
converted to string method.
The java toString() method is used when we need a string representation of an object. It is defined in Object class. 
This method can be overridden to customize the String representation of the Object.


18.what is iterater ?
Iterator interface provides the facility of iterating the elements in forward direction only.
Methods of Iterator interface

There are only three methods in the Iterator interface. They are:

public boolean hasNext() it returns true if iterator has more elements.
public object next() it returns the element and moves the cursor pointer to the next element.
public void remove() it removes the last elements returned by the iterator. It is rarely used.

19.what is hashmap *(change)
	
	HashMap maintains key and value pairs and often denoted as HashMap<Key, Value> or HashMap<K, V>. 
HashMap implements Map interface.It neither does any kind of sorting to the stored keys and Values. You must need to import java.util.HashMap or its super class in order to use the HashMap class and methods

**20.what is synchronization block and method (checked)
			
synchronized method -acquires a method on the whole object. 
This means no other thread can use any synchronized method in the whole object while the method is being run by one thread. 

synchronized blocks -acquires a lock in the object between parentheses after the synchronized keyword
	
21.difference b/w java.utill.date and java.sql.date*
	      
		 1.java.sql.Date is a thin wrapper around millisecond value which is used by JDBC to identify an SQL DATE type.

            2. java.sql.Date just represent DATE without time information while java.util.Date represent both Date and Time information. This is the major differences why java.util.Date can not directly map to java.sql.Date.

            3. In order to suppress time information and to conform with definition of ANSI SQL DATE type, the millisecond values used in java.sql.Date instance must be "normalized by setting the hours, minutes, seconds and milliseconds to zero in the timezone with with DATE instance is associated. 

In other words all time related information is removed from java.sql.Date class.




22.what is static and dynmaic polymorphism *

	static  :polymorphism is compile time.
	dynamic :polymorphism is run time.

                         (view)
Q1.what is jsp
    Ans:-JavaServer Pages (JSP) is a technology that helps software developers create 
	dynamically generated web pages based on HTML, XML, or other document types. 
	Released in 1999 by Sun Microsystems, JSP is similar to PHP and ASP, but it uses the 
	Java programming language

Q2.jsp life cycle

Ans:-A JSP page is converted into Servlet in order to service requests. 
The translation of a JSP page to a Servlet is called Lifecycle of JSP. JSP Lifecycle is 
exactly same as the Servlet Lifecycle, with one additional first step, which is, translation 
of JSP code to Servlet code. Following are the JSP Lifecycle steps:

a.Translation of JSP to Servlet code.
b.Compilation of Servlet to bytecode.
c.Loading Servlet class.
d.Creating servlet instance.
e.Initialization by calling jspInit() method
f.Request Processing by calling _jspService() method
g.Destroying by calling jspDestroy() method

Q3.jsp element

Ans:-JSP Scripting element are written inside <% %> tags. These code inside <% %> tags 
are processed by the JSP engine during translation of the JSP page. Any other text in the 
JSP page is considered as HTML code or plain text.
There are five different types of scripting elements

Scripting Element		Example
Comment			<%-- comment --%>
Directive		<%@ directive %>
Declaration		<%! declarations %>
Scriptlet		<% scriplets %>
Expression		<%= expression %>

Q4.execption handling jsp

The exception is normally an object that is thrown at runtime. Exception Handling is 
the process to handle the runtime errors. There may occur exception any time in your web 
application. So handling exceptions is a safer side for the web developer. In JSP, there are 
two ways to perform exception handling:

a.By errorPage and isErrorPage attributes of page directive
b.By <error-page> element in web.xml file

Q5.difeerence b/w Directive and action tag

Ans:-Include directive and include action tag both are used for including a file to the 
current JSP page. However there is a difference in the way they include file. Before I explain
 the difference between them, lets have a brief about each one.

Q6.describe <jsp:usebean> tag

Ans:-The jsp:useBean action tag is used to locate or instantiate a bean class. 
If bean object of the Bean class is already created, it doesn't create the bean depending on 
the scope. But if object of bean is not created, it instantiates the bean.


Q7.what is implicit object why we use

There are 9 jsp implicit objects. These objects are created by the web container that 
are available to all the jsp pages.
The available implicit objects are out, request, config, session, application etc.
A list of the 9 implicit objects is given below:

Object						Type
out					JspWriter
request					HttpServletRequest
response				HttpServletResponse
config					ServletConfig
application				ServletContext
session					HttpSession
pageContext				PageContext
page					Object
exception				Throwable


Q8.what is scope of bean
Ans:-

Q9.what is servlet annotation

Ans:-Annotation represents the metadata. If you use annotation, deployment descriptor
 (web.xml file) is not required. But you should have tomcat7 as it will not run in the 
previous versions of tomcat. @WebServlet annotation is used to map the servlet with the 
specified name.

Q10.@webServlet and @filter use
Ans:-

Q11.what is filter

Ans:-A filter is an object that is invoked at the preprocessing and postprocessing of a 
request.
It is mainly used to perform filtering tasks such as conversion, logging, compression, 
encryption and decryption, input validation etc.
The servlet filter is pluggable, i.e. its entry is defined in the web.xml file, 
if we remove the entry of filter from the web.xml file, filter will be removed automatically 
and we don't need to change the servlet
	

            Usage of Filter

a.recording all incoming requests
b.logs the IP addresses of the computers from which the requests originate
c.conversion
d.data compression
e.encryption and decryption
f.input validation etc.
	
         Advantage of Filter

a.Filter is pluggable.
b.One filter don't have dependency onto another resource.
c.Less Maintenance

Q12.filter life cycle & why we used filterchain object.

Ans:- filters life cycle:
The life cycle of a filter is managed by a container. Every
filter must implement the Filter interface. The life cycle
of a filter consists of implementing the following methods:

1. init(): This method is called only once after
instantiation to perform any initialization task.

2. doFilter(): This method is called after the init()
method. It takes three arguments, namely a ServletRequest, a
ServletResponse, and a FilterChain. It is called each time a
filter needs to perform any function. This method performs
the actual work of a filter, either modifying the request or
the response.

3. destroy(): This method is used to perform any cleanup
operation before the container removes a filter instance.

Q13.why we used filterchain object
Ans:- to call next configure filter

Q14.what and why filter Configuration
Ans:- An object of FilterConfig is created by the web container. This object can be used to 
get the configuration information from the web.xml file.

Q15.what is frontcontroller
Ans:- The front controller software design pattern is listed in several pattern catalogs and 
related to the design of Web applications. It is "a controller that handles all requests for a 
Web site", which is a useful structure for Web application developers to achieve the 
flexibility and reuse without code redundancy.

Q16.why we used frontcontroller
Ans:- The front controller software design pattern is listed in several pattern 
catalogs and related to the design of Web applications. It is "a controller that handles 
all requests for a Web site", which is a useful structure for Web application developers to 
achieve the flexibility and reuse without code redundancy.

Q17.write a code frontcontroller
Ans:-

Q18.difference b/w authentication and authorization
Ans:-
a.Authentication is the process of verifying who you are. When you log on to a 
PC with a user name and password you are authenticating.

b.Authorization is the process of verifying that you have access to something. 
Gaining access to a resource (e.g. directory on a hard disk) because the permissions
 configured on it allow you access is authorization.

Q19.whAT IS the version of jsp
Ans:-2.3

Q20.how many instance of a jsp are created to handle multiple concurrent user request
Ans:-single

Q21.why we use jsp as a view
Ans:-JavaServer Pages are built on top of the Java Servlets API, 
so like Servlets, JSP also has access to all the powerful Enterprise Java APIs, 
including JDBC, JNDI, EJB, JAXP, etc. JSP pages can be used in combination with servlets 
that handle the business logic, the model supported by Java servlet template engines.

Q22.how you can define method in a jsp
Ans;- 

Q23.how you can declare instance variable in a jsp
Ans:-jsp:use bean tag

Q.3 : What are the responsibilities of Model, View and Controller components?
Ans.
The Model
Model contains persistent data and the business methods to perform business operations on this data and store the data into database. Ideally one Model represents one RDBMS table. One instance of a Model represents one record of a Table. Model contains business logics, data access logics, integration logics to perform business operations and manipulate database.

The View

View components are responsible to render the graphical user interface. User can enter input data using UI input forms or can see application data as different reports.
View contains presentation logics and display data from Model object. If Model data will be changed view will be changed.
View gets its data from Controller to display at user interface as Model object.
View submits its data to its Controller on a user action. A user action is a button click or a menu item selection from the user interface.
Ideally one View has one Controller. When a large data record is to be displayed in groups at UI then multiple Views will have single Controller.
Web applications implement View by JSPs, Desktop applications implement View by Swing/AWT Frame classes.

The Controller

Controllers contain navigation logics and are responsible to perform business operation submitted by View with the help of Model.
Navigation logics are used to determine next View to be displayed after successful or unsuccessful execution of business operation.
The View submits data to the Controller when user clicks on a button or clicks on a menu item from UI. Controller populates submitted data into Model and calls business method to perform business operation. After performing business operation Controller forward control to the next View.
Web applications implement Controller using Servlets. Desktop applications implement Controller using listener classes.

Q.4 : How many type of logic are there?
Ans. Application logics can be categorized into five categories

1. Presentation Logics: This is the set of control statements that decide look and feel of an applications user interface. It is also called View Logic. JSP pages and Swing/AWT Frame classes represent view logics.

2. Control Logics: This is the set of control statements that decide navigation of user interface falls under this category. It will conditionally decide which next page will be displayed to User. These are also known as navigation logic.

3. Business Logics: This is the set of control statements that perform business operations. Operation such as fund transfer, change password, book order, and payment are the examples of business operations.

4. Data Access Logics: This is the set of control statements which perform database manipulation are called Data Access Logics. JDBC or SQL calls to manipulate data into the database are called data access logics.

5. Integration Logics: This is the set of control statements that integrate application with another applications or servers. For example SMS server, FTP server, Email server integration code is part of these logics.

Q.5 : Which logic will you write in different MVC components?
Ans . View : Presentation Logics

Controller : Control Logics

Model : Business Logics, Data Access Logics, Integration Logics.
